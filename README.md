# **SLOTS-O-FUN FOR ALL**

#### Do you ever yearn for the casinos of Las Vegas, wondering how to throw away hundreds, if not thousands of dollars? I know for a fact that I do. I designed this simple slot machine for anyone to use mostly because, for legal reasons, I cannot gamble (I am 19). This slot machine has a bit of a ‚ú® personality ‚ú®, but at its core, it functions as you would expect. As a forewarning, though this slot machine is virtual, you still will get scammed because that's just how casinos work. I wish you the best of luck and hopefully you strike it big! 

## Gameplay!

#### You are first greeted by Slots-O-Fun, who will ask for your name. Then, you are given 100 dollars to start with. You can bet any amount you want by typing it in the textbox. Continue to bet until you run out of money, where you can either leave your computer and give up, adjust your bet, or go visit the virtual ATM. 

## How to Win

#### Easy. Get three of the same emoji and you win. The rarer the emoji, the more you win. Your payout is calculated by multiplying your bet by the multiplier for that jackpot.  If you get two of same emoji, you win nothing. If you have no matching emojis, you also get nothing. 

### Multipliers

#### üçá = 20x
#### üçí = 30x
#### üçã = 40x
#### üé∞ = 100x
#### üíé = 250x
#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ = 10000x

####  Your bets are supposed to be numbers like "19," but try some invalid inputs and see what Slots-O-Fun has to say about it. 
#### Goodluck and have fun!
